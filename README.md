# Parkinson-disease-ML-classifier-
Parkinson's disease is a brain disorder that causes unintended or uncontrollable 
movements, such as shaking, stiffness, and difficulty with balance and coordination. 
The research-based project where our goal was to create a program that gave us the 
basic initiation on which model would be the best choice for prediction of 
Parkinson’s disease. We took data from UCI machine learning  repository which consists
of 22 vocal parameters of 195 patients. The ‘status’ column 
is a binary classification of whether the person of a certain vocal parameter has 
Parkinson disease or not. We used seven different classification algorithms and 
calculated different performance analysis tests and concluding SVC with near perfect 
score.
